# My First Chrome Extension
Welcome to my first chrome extension! This is a simple Chrome extension spurred by two reasons.

1. I had recently just started using laptops with not as strong processors (like the very old Macbook Air and a Chromebook), and using Google Chrome, as we all know, definitely hogs a lot of CPU since each tab has its own process. Therefore, this extension serves to help me manage my tab usage better by alerting me when I haven't been idle on a tab for a while
2. Learning the overall process of making extensions, and practicing my Javascript.
